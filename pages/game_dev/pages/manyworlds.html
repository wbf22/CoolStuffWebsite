                            I'm currently in the devlopment of this game called ManyWorlds. At least that's the working title. 
                            So far, all I've created is a minecraft style terrain gen with some differences:

                            This has allowed me to sort of do a level of detail esk thing, where I load in a smaller amount of actual blocks nearest
                            to the player, and then load larger and larger place holders for chunks farther away. Here's one of the early renders I 
                            got working:

                            Pretty cool eh! You can see that farther out in the distance the blocks are larger. This allows me to render out ~10,000m for the
                            same amount of blocks as rendering 256m in minecraft. I thought this would be nice way to allow you to see more of a long distance view in the game.
                            It does come at the cost of blockiness farther out though.

                            The image above was taken before I implemented erosion or did anywork on rendering different types of blocks like grass or different kinds of rock.
                            Planning the heirachy was a bit tricky since I had to divide the chunks up evenly for each sub group. To figure this out I drew this diagram/picture which
                            I thought was actually kind of pretty to look at as well:

                            One of the most challenging aspects of this is that I don't load in all the world chunks at once.

                            I've found that I have to start at the highest level chunk, run the rivers around it's sub chunks, and at that point agree on where the rivers should connect
                            between those sub chunks. Tricky!

                            Then once I start generating those sub chunks, I have to make sure I get the river to come out at the previously agreed upon point. Through many attempts and
                            stepping with the debugger, I've arrived at this system

                            Something that really helped was making a way to visualize the chunks while I was in the debugger. Since I was running the terrain gen continuously, I couldn't view
                            the terrain in the game, so I made a little tool that printed out the chunk to a file. Here's a screenshot of the output of this:

                            Kind of hard to see, but the little arrows indicate the way water is flowing and the number in the bottom left of each chunk (square) is the height of that chunk.

                            I'm still currently debugging this but as I've got to know and understand this problem I've been able to simplify my solution a lot. I've noticed with problems like
                            this, you typically have to create a failed solution so you can get to know the problem better. Then the second time around you can make a really good solution. Sometimes
                            it takes more tries than that, but usually I've never had to restart more than once (thankfully).

                            Currently I've been working on the erosion (same as always). I decided to do the river tracing differently
                            then I was previously. Now we're starting from outflows and stepping up until we reach all subchunks in a chunk. This is
                            much more efficient then trying to walk from each index to an outflow. The old method was exceptionally complicated
                            when going through lakes or flat areas, where it isn't clear which way is downhill or towards the outflow.
